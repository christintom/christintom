I’m a junior software developer with a strong foundation in ASP.NET, Joomla (including HikaShop), WordPress, and SQL Server. I’ve worked on a variety of client websites, handling everything from layout customization to backend development and reporting. I also have experience with Excel reporting, SharePoint basics, and maintaining legacy systems. I enjoy problem-solving, learning new technologies, and creating efficient, user-friendly solutions. Currently, I'm aiming to grow into a senior developer role, take on more complex projects, and expand my expertise in modern web development frameworks.
